# Nebulae
Nebulae is an editing app made in love2d for fun, idk how this will go

Nebulae doesn't use the offical builds of love2d, the build it uses is avaliable here: https://github.com/MikuAuahDark/love2d/tree/nav

Nebulae only supports love 12.0, 11.5 and lower are likely not to work.

Nebulae currently only offically supports Windows (and theoretically android with NAV), I dont have a Linux or Mac machine.
